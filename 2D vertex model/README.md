# vertex-model
This repository contains a collection of MATLAB-based computational models for simulating the mechanical behavior and morphological evolution of organoids.  
The models are based on vertex/trapezoidal approximations and viscous dynamics, exploring how surface tensions, pressure, and ECM interactions drive organoid growth, shape changes, and response to perturbations.  
# 1. Morphological Evolution   
This module investigates the global equilibrium shapes of organoids under varying mechanical parameters.  
# 2. Ablation & Healing (ablation_healing)  
This module simulates local perturbations, specifically laser ablation of a single cell or group of cells, and the subsequent topological healing process.
# 3. Osmotic Pressure Change (osm_change)
This module explores the dynamic response of organoids to changes in internal hydrostatic pressure (osmotic shock).   
# Prerequisites:
MATLAB R2018b or later.
Ensure all .m files are in the same directory or added to the MATLAB path.
Helper functions like intital.m, quad_area.m, and compute_total_energy.m must be present.
